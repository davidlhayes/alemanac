Project #2

Beer App


Summary: Tentatively named 'Point of Brew', this app will have both beer search functionality and CRUD functionality within a 'beer journal'.

User Flow: Users are first prompted to login, once they've logged in they are taken to a page where than can either choose to search, choose to go to their journal page, or choose to edit/view a beer that they've previously logged. The search functionality will be provided by the Brewery DB API and users will be able to search by a pre-defined set of parameters. The journal functionality will be created using SQL/ActiveRecord and users will be able to save beers that they've tried with notes and ratings.

Technologies:
-Ruby
-SQL
-ActiveRecord
-Bootstrap
